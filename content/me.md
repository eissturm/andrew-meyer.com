# The Beginning
It was a warm summer day in the Twin Cities, MN. I was 10, maybe 11, so we're talking 2002, and my dad drove my friend and I into the office with him. 10 Riverpark Plaza is still there, a glass tower on the flats across the river from downtown St Paul. It would be the scene of many formative moments in my life, but those will be other stories. That day, while my dad was busy working on something property management-related in his office upstairs, he let two ten year olds loose on a room of stacked up computers left behind by one of the building's old tenants, giving them a copy of Windows 2000 and a set of instructions to figure out which computers worked, and to re-install Windows on them.

I spent most of that day working through row after row of these boxes, plugging them in one-by-one to the keyboard and monitor setup. My friend got distracted a few computers in and insisted on getting his own working to play games. I think we got through five or six of them in the several hours we were down there. I got to take one home with me.

That sparked the realization that I could _make_ computers. They could be built, tweaked, customized and built to suit a particular purpose. For me that was most often games. I used that computer we brought home to emulate old Nintendo and Super Nintendo games. I'd been five when those systems had been relevant, and enjoyed the experience of learning where some of my favorite Nintendo 64 games had come from. But I knew, even then that the possibilities were endless, and that computerization had the ability to transform every aspect of life.

I think it was the next summer where I checked out my first book on C from the St Cloud Public Library with my grandpa. I didn't make it very far, so we went back and got BASIC. I liked that one a lot more. I remember I'd somehow convinced my dad to let me have one of the old laptops in the office, and I was using it to do emulators and learn programming that summer. I made all kinds of really weird text story adventures. I think I also got into HTML and Javascript that same year.  I remember not doing BASIC for very long, and never really progressed in game development, thinking web development was where it was at.

# In lieu of education

While I'd met Linux a few years before, it was 2004 or 2005 when I first installed Ubuntu. I was now a Linux kid. This was a glorious era. Compiz effects, Desktop Cube, amorak music player, hacking ipods to share music, and all other kinds of weird and out there technology.  If it ran Linux it still gets extra points, even to this day.

I spent a lot of time through these years separated from the computer. My grades weren't stellar and my parents believed that screens were to blame. I was, in retrospect, generally under-challenged in my public schools, which rarely touched on my interests or things I felt would be relevant into the future. I wasn't good at homework. I still feel as though education is missing the mark there, but I'll admit that I may have made things harder for myself than they needed to be, too.

College wasn't great for me. It's hard when you're in a downward trajectory to see where exactly it began, and even harder when you're a kid who isn't taught how to advocate for themselves. You go to bad places. You make bad choices because you already know you're disconnected from the outcome you wanted. I was never going to get what I wanted.

# Retail as old as time

Go back to 2007. I'm a junior in highscool and I just got my first job at a Best Buy in the Computer Sales department.  I was too young, for liability reasons, to be a Geek Squad agent. Not that that stopped me from consulting with the Geek Squad on how to get things done and solve problems on computers. This is the first time I was really, really challenged in work or school. A coworker of mine wanted me gone. I was probably annoying him, treating him like an equal even though he was twice my age, and so he decided he wanted to push me out. I didn't understand what I was doing wrong, other than trying to be great at my job. Heh. I'm as old now as he was then. That guy sucks. I've got to thank a number of people who were honest with me, spoke straight, and set me on my way. That store, those guys there, taught me skills and lessons I was never going to pick up working maintenance for my dad.

Speaking of choices... I didn't know marijuana stayed in your system for so long when I returned to that store my summer after freshman year. I was clean, but still failed the drug test the made me take for my position. I was embarassed and devastated. I couldn't believe it. As with all things in youth it was one of the biggest problems I'd ever faced. I spent that summer doing maintenance again, and a Barnes & Noble, selling e-readers. Fun. That lasted nine months before I'd "embarassed" the general manager too many times and was fired. That was a frustrating experience, where I think the takeaway was that I should make sure to include my management when I take initiative.

At this point, I'm 21 and I join a phone store trying to bootstrap. We were a "premium retailer". We got to know the neighborhood and the little shopping area. I think this time began my love affair with walkability. Spent a lot of time learning to sell here. Some time managing. I did a lot of the repair work myself. This was honestly two really good years. Then the owner moved off to California and left us all out to dry.

Back to maintenance one more time while I went on the job hunt for...  something. I'd given up on tech, believing my lack of degree and, frankly, mental health issues, were going to be dealbreakers. When I had to go in to work at 3 am to help unclog a sewer main, I knew it was time to figure it the hell out. Nights and weekend became focus time. I stopped gaming. I got to work on my certificates. I tired school again, but it didn't take. I started getting a lot of rejections. That part never gets easier.

# The Break-in

That's probably an inappropriate title, given that they actually did have a break-in just before I was hired at Code42. They are(were?) a databackup and protection company that sold a product called CrashPlan. They had just tired, and failed to launch a Dropbox competetor called SharePlan, which was...  fine?  In my time there it was mostly referred to as a joke, a callback to a simpler time. I was a Techical Support Analyst, working on the Seeds service. This is the first job I automated myself out of. Soon, I was working with enterprise clients, then selling to enterprise clients. In my nearly four years there, I accomplished a lot. I wrote code, I changed processes, I sold use cases that defined eventual products. My life fundamentally changed.

I went in to Code42 a kid who had never been further from home than Chicago, IL. I left a kid who woke up one day to sunrise over the Atlantic, and watched the sunset that same night into the Pacific. I had been on the phone, toe to toe with admins and security responders in crisis at companies like Apple, Cisco, and Oracle. I had spoken at JNUC (sort of). Code42 was yet another place that challenged me, forced me to grow, and rewarded me for it.

# Resilience

Then I got laid off. Really, it was their loss. If it wasn't for networking though, I'd probably have been worse off than I was, and never would have found my way to where I am today. I've been fortunate enough to work with organizations of every size and scale, and have helped teams through some of the biggested news events in recent history.

Where to begin? What a year 2023 has been. A lot has happened, and I'm excited to catch you all up on everything.

TL;DR: I have had a great year, personally and professionally.  My family is happy and healthy, and I seem to shit gold in my career.

## Writing

I'm writing again, obviously. I'm excited about it, and it feels really good to be putting "pen" to "paper" so to speak, after a concerted effort this November to try a NaNoWriMo. I didn't succeed in cranking out everything, but I ended the month with a lot of momentum on this project.

>*The Crystal Empire(working title)* will be a standalone epic fantasy featuring compelling characters, adventure through a fantastic world, insidious intrigue, secrets lost to time, and spectacular magical crystal combat.

I'm looking forward to sharing more about this project as it progresses.

In the meantime, I've also resolved to make some of my backlog of stories available in some way through this site in whatever formats people prefer.  Keep an eye on the [Works](/works) section of this site for updates and ways to access content!

## Personal

Toddlers are hard, but also so dang cute.

Deep in the dark underbelly of the King's newly constructed temple, three magae struggle to work the divine arts which have propelled their kingdom to heights not seen in centuries.

The Lion's Dance was first written in Aril 2024. It takes place before [Spring of Black Flowers](/works/sunset-kingdom-1/).

# The Lion’s Dance


“What does it mean?” the acolyte asked. “I ask and I ask but all I see is a lion snarling at me, intending to rip my flesh from my bones.”  

The chamber was dark save for the flickers of pale green light thrown from the brazier casting the cool, underground chamber and its occupants in a deep darkness. Standing above the acolyte, his two masters watched approving of his progress, one much more visibly so than the other. Though with the darkness so essential to the Art and their acolyte so inexperienced Darien’s lapse in composure hardly mattered.  

Darien placed his hand on the acolyte’s shoulder to reassure him, but he spoke to the other man, who had once been his own master.  

“Even he sees it,” Darien said. “This thing that comes for us and blocks our sight. With all we have on the line, do you still think we can do nothing?”  

The old master sighed. “Darien, you are worrying the boy with this. We have already discussed this privately and nothing of our plans must change. You know that the Arts grow unpredictable when the Little Sister draws so near.”  

So the old man often said. Darien himself did not put faith in superstitious things like the movement of the moons and alignment of the stars. It was why he had turned against the pagan cults and embraced the true light of their Lord in the first place. In his time with the old man, Darien had learned the truth behind secrets great men had died to keep buried. Xanurosh’s well of wisdom proved time and time again to be potable and very, very deep. Darien tried not to begrudge the old man his reverence for the stars then, preferring it to think of it as some quirk of his age and his origin far to the east. They had worked too hard for too long to be subject to celestial whims.  

“I... I know those eyes,” the Acolyte said nervously. “I have met this gaze before, but I don’t know where.”  

Darien stopped and looked back at the boy.  

He knelt unblinking, staring into the wan green flames, muttering the mantra in little more than a quiet whisper, the green light casting the boy’s long face and sharp features in stark shadows.  

“Speak up boy,” Darien commanded. “What was that you said?”  

It was a long moment before the acolyte broke his trance and looked up.  

“The beast is familiar, as if I should know it... No matter where I look, it is there to meet me. What does it mean?”  

“Master?” The question was more a challenge than it was deferential.  

The old man’s eyes were fixed on the brazier and the green flame burning at its heart, past it even, his expression impassive. All were signs Darien had learned to associate over the last several decades with his master’s silently working the Sight. While Xanurosh had taught Darien much and more about every facet of the Arts, his specialty was in Seeing. They had learned long ago that Darien’s talents lay elsewhere.  

Xanurosh sighed, breaking his trance and turning away from the brazier.  

“It is as you say, Darien,” the master said as he lifted a lantern onto a dark table beside them. “No matter what I ask, my sight is blocked by this vision.”  

He drew out a wick and lit it from the green flame in the brazier, which came away a mundane orange as the old man placed it into the lantern. The clever contraption relied on a reservoir of oil rather than captured insects as was common in these parts of the continent west of the Empire, and offered much more consistent light.  

“Come, both of you,” he continued. “There is nothing more for us to gain this day.”  

With the final word, he closed the lantern shut and began to amble his way out of the chamber.   

The acolyte looked to Darien, who nodded. As the boy took off after their master, Darien reached his hand over the brazier and the small green flame burning strong in its center. It took only a scant moment’s concentration for him to grab hold of the tiny nexus of power circling the brazier and only a whisper in the ancient tongue and a sip of his very Life to disperse it. That instant the light was gone and the brazier would have been cold to the touch, as if it had not felt a flame in years. Which, strictly speaking, it hadn’t.  

They climbed the fifty rough steps carved into the sandstone, then emerged into one of the dark hallways winding their way like a maze below the sanctum of Gara. The old man did not wait, of course, and soon his lantern light slipped behind a hidden turn in the corridor provoking a yelp from the apprentice who scurried after him. Darien followed in a leisurely pace, having long memorized the way while the stonemasons had first been laying the temple’s foundations five years ago.  

A dim light dithered down the final set of stone steps as he rose into the great hall of the Sanctum of the Earthlord. The ever rising roof on this place never ceased to fill him with at least some awe as men worked, lifting massive stones into the air and arranging them against each other in precarious, impossible arrangements that they assured everyone would support their weight for thousands of years. In times before a temple on this scale might have taken generations to build to its final, grandest scale, and yet this one would be finished within the decade. And King Ulemaro was building another temple of equal grandeur on the other side in his new capital of Moredo, dedicated to the Skylady. This, among others, was one of the areas where Xanurosh’s wisdom surpassed belief.  

A sect nearly two hundred strong already staffed the temple and serviced patrons from all across the King’s ever expanding kingdom, a similar story to institutions across the city as it grew and grew on the back of the King’s victories in the Vale. Green-robed monks led their patrons out of his path as he drew near, some nodding to him as he passed, making his path through the surprisingly crowded room easier. He was soon able to catch up to both master and acolyte before they reached the threshold and out into the bright midday sun.  

A line of men and women complained as the three of them pushed past and were admitted by the guards on sight, a petty display of power Darien could never resist reveling in. Merchants, nobles, knights, and even priests could complain, but none of them had the ear of the King like his scholars did, nor the privileges that came with it. It was strange then that today, the normally blessedly clear hallways of the Royal Palace at Moredo were practically crowded.  

His acolyte flagged down one of the palace’s guards, who fell into step ahead of them and cleared a path as they made their way to their destination, the royal throne room. At no point along the way could they have let the guard go, and they had to push through some standing group of servants or soldiers at nearly every doorway.  

“What is going on?” Darien wondered aloud as they neared their destination. Nearly the whole court had assembled in a rush, and the crowd was at its thickest in the atrium just before the throne room. Here, lords and ladies, knights, merchants, and priests conversed in small clusters orbiting a large tree that was becoming something of a symbol of Ulemaro’s new kingdom.   

Dark might be the best way to describe it, dark wood under dark bark, and usually it grew in vibrant green leaves. There had been some during the castle’s construction who wanted it removed, but it had been preserved at the queen’s insistence. Now, years later, she had finally been vindicated when the tree budded thousands of tiny flowers the color of midnight that seemed to soak in sunlight and filled the atrium with a warm, powerful scent. The crowd, it seemed, did not find it as alluring as he did, giving the tree a wide berth.  

“You didn’t know?” the acolyte asked, provoking an irritated twitch of Darien’s eyebrow. The boy quickly added, “I’m sorry master. We received word that Aldri..”  

Just then, the enormous wooden doors to the throne room swung open, and a man wearing a crimson uniform of a general, a jeweled longsword at his hip, and a black cloak trailing behind strode out, his heavy brow furrowed in frustration, trailed by several attendants. The lord’s traditional outfit and rejection of the mustache popular among the elites of King Ulemaro’s growing kingdom marked him as one of the lords of Erazel, the backwards land across the sea that had begged Ulemaro to be their king. This one, in particular, had proven himself to be a useful tool, becoming something of a hero to the soldiers of Ulemaro’s armies and peasants in the lands liberated in their reconquest. The lord covered his mouth with his cloak and sneezed, then looked up, noticing the three scholars his scowl became an unpleasantly courteous smile.  

“Prince Ulvello,” the lord addressed the acolyte first, but he eyed Darien and his master each in turn. It was a calm but heavy gaze, of a warrior sizing up a foe confident no conflict will occur that Darien had seen from many men in his life, and from this man in particular. “You truly are a man devoted to your studies. I rather think scholarship suits you.”  

The boy nodded.   

“Only a fool rejects wisdom,” he said, quoting from one the holy texts. Darien noted to himself that he was going to have to break the boy of that habit before too long. “We did not expect you back from the front so soon Sir Gareth.”  

“Your father said as much too,” Gareth nodded. “With the barbarians pushed out and new lords being settled in the upper vale, my men and I have been feeling redundant. By your father’s leave, we are returning home to Erazel for the season. We have been away too long and there’s much to prepare for.”  

Gareth had locked eyes with Darien as he spoke that last part. There were few people in this kingdom who could do that without being intimidated by his rather imposing size.  

“So soon?” Ulvello asked. “You’ve only just arrived.”  

“On the morrow. I will be dining with the king this evening, as there are some matters of importance for he and I to discuss. Your grace.”   

Gareth nodded to Ulvello, dismissing himself.   

He placed his hand on Darien’s shoulder as he passed, standing an inch or two taller than Darien himself was, and leaned in.  

“Take good care of our boy Darien Moongrave.”  

Darien glared at the backwater knight pretending to be a lord and said nothing. After only a moment, Gareth removed his hand and passed on.  

“That man thinks too highly of himself,” Ulvello muttered as Gareth sneezed passing the blossoming tree.  

“Entirely,” Darien agreed.  

They entered the throne room for their royal audience. It was routine things, and Darien found it difficult to keep his focus on the matters at hand, instead his mind kept replaying that conversation with the knight, feeling that there was an important detail that he had missed.  

It did not come to him until hours later, as the sun hung low over the city and into the windows of the royal lecture hall. Darien was among the scholars, listening to the latest from Imperial researchers visiting from distant Saireth to the south, when he realized what had unsettled him so much about his conversation with Gareth Aldrimar. It was a subtle thing, but something he was ashamed to have missed, hidden in the natural way Aldrimar had said the name. *Moongrave.* A name no man alive should have known, nor had any clue of Darien’s connection to it. That secret should have died twenty years ago... That could undo half a century of work.  

Darien itched at his shoulder as he stood, and politely excused himself. There would be talk about why he had left lectures early that night, there always was talk when he did anything, but it was an open secret that the deeper Arts allowed practitioners to silently ‘summon’ one another. They would find excuses for him.  

He found his former student sitting alone beneath a tree in the palace gardens. The slender, thin faced man wore dark robes, and had his eyes closed as he chanted his mantra. The only mantra that had ever worked for him, and only ever for him. Master Xanurosh had known, somehow, when Darien had first introduced his once-promising student that he would not progress far in their arts, even the master had eventually acknowledged that Rua represented one of the greater mysteries of the Arts, and a useful one at that.  

Darien could feel the chill as he approached, but knew better than to chant for heat. Rua had made it as far as he had in their order simply by exploiting his ability to draw the heat from the world around him, exhausting his opponents quickly as they nearly froze to death. Though in the end he had shown no talent for the True Arts, Rua’s particular talent for making corpses had proven invaluable to Darien in his own pursuits over the years.  

The thin man broke his chant and looked up to meet Darien’s gaze with his coal black eyes. The air shimmered around him as though his body were a forge, and the frost rose around him as mist. It was possibly the most heat Darien had ever seen the man take in at once.  

“Master?” he asked in a soft, unsettlingly gentle voice.“How may I serve?”  

Years ago, Rua had chafed at his position as a mere tool, but he had seen the light, and was more than willing to serve in the limited capacity he could. Devotion could make a man do strange, terrible things, as Darien knew all too well.   

“Come with me,” Darien said. “There is something I must do, and I require your expertise.”  

The man stood in a smooth motion, leaving behind a ring of charred grass and nodded. There were no more words needed between them after so long. Darien had always dismissed those who had relied on the Arts for their influence over people when he had never found so obedient a slave as a willing one. He led the way out of the gardens and to the stables, where they were hitching up a team to a carriage when they heard a woman’s voice call out to them.  

“That kind of business again, Darien?” asked the queen with a knowing, bemused smile. She sat horseback, wearing an elegant gold and white riding dress with her copper colored hair done up around a large golden pin, then left to cascade down between her shoulders. She slid gracefully off her horse, her deep green eyes locked on his own, promising him much and more and nothing at all.  

Beside him Rua bowed, his dark robe drooping loosely as he did. Darien however merely grinned, standing his ground as she approached. Such was his right with his former apprentices. Queen Asenia of Moredo was not much taller than the average woman in the vale, standing almost high enough to look him in the eye in her raised heel boots, yet she towered over nearly everyone around her. She was, after all, the most powerful woman on Dvor.  

“Your highness\! I am happy to report that your son’s studies are progressing well enough,” Darien said, ignoring her question.  

The queen’s amusement vanished in a moment, her green eyes giving him a hardened glare.  

“Indeed? He tells me often of what he sees in the flames, though he laments how slowly he is learning new material.”  

Darien opened his mouth to speak but she cut him off.  

“And don’t you say, or not say, another unkind word about my children. Don’t think I didn’t catch that.”  

He sighed.  

“What can I say Asenia? The boy is a fine apprentice. Insightful, on occasion, but never brilliant. Not like his mother.”  

She considered him a moment, never taking her eyes off his.  

Finally, she asked. “Who is it?”  

He felt his blood pumping in his veins, his heart racing, like a man about to leave the village to hunt a terrible beast. “A man who has trespassed in my business,” was all the explanation he offered.  

“Which is *my* business,” Asenia interjected. “Who?”  

Her eyes had not left his as they both watched, evaluated each other, planning their move should the other move this way or that way first. Unlike Rua, this student had grown to become a master herself in time, and had even become his equal in some of the Arts. Darien began to visualize a loop of violet light forming around her neck.  

Asenia’s hand snapped to her throat and she spoke a Word. His loop dissipated and he felt his arms forced together rightly around the wrists. When he glanced back, he saw a net of violet light constricting him. A moment too late, the royal guard drew their sword and looked about for the source of the disturbance,  

“Answer the question, Darien,” the queen practically growled.  

He spoke an ancient word, filling it with enough of his Life’s power to blast back a man twenty feet. And nothing happened. Five feet away, the empress stood allowing a triumphant grin to break her composure.  

“Aldrimar.”  

He felt the bonds at his wrists loosen and the queen gave him a look of satisfaction. He gave Rua a look of frustration. The tall man had just stood there.  

“Was that so hard? What, did you think I would object to you ridding us of that nuisance?”  

Then, she turned, catching the late afternoon sun in her copper hair.  

“I suppose you mean to free my husband from his dinner plans?”  

Darien nodded.  

“Then you should go. Aldrimar arrives early to these things.”  

With that, she turned and headed towards the palace, her guard close at heel. Moments later, Darien caught the queen watching them go from one of the palace windows while Rua was driving them out into the city beyond the palace walls. They drove down newly cobbled streets, past new buildings of white pouredstone plaster and red clay tiles for roofs, through markets teeming with activity until they reached the edge of the city.  

Rua drove the carriage at a leisurely pace, Darien sitting inside lounging, looking out the opened window for his prey. Gareth Aldrimar, like all nobles, maintained a villa in the lands outside the city, though word was the Erazi man had hardly decorated the place, and his family had not yet made the journey from the western peninsula. That wasn’t where they were going but it was a useful direction to head while they looked for their quarry.  

“Master,” Rua said.  

He could see them up ahead, another carriage was rolling towards them along the road with a small escort of spearmen wearing black and crimson. One rider rode ahead, revealing his plated armor and the sword at his hip while shouting for Rua to pull their carriage aside and make way. Darien had already explained to him their plan.  

The air grew colder than a winter’s night, but danced around the black robed man as he stood, slid a dagger from his robe and launched himself at the knight. Darien took control of the horses by the glowing loops of binding light around their necks, hidden under their harnesses. As he touched them with his mind, he could feel their wills recede as their bodies became an extension of his own will.  

*Attack,* he ordered the horses with his mind, and they charged ahead in response. He stepped casually out of the carriage before it gathered too much speed, and looked behind him to where Rua had pinned the knight, who now screamed in agony as his armor was reforged with him wearing it. The other carriage tried to swerve, but it took only a portion of Darien’s concentration to force his own horses to chase after before their own will took over, but it was enough. Both carriages’ horses became tangled, tripped, and caused Aldrimar’s carriage to turn sideways, almost spilling its contents into the road while Darien’s rolled over onto its side.  

The spearmen were already charging, and Darien’s sword was drawn. He was no great swordsman, but these were not foes for him to fear. In a blink, he drew a binding around each of the charging horses necks, and he spoke the ancient Words to banish them, compelling them to retreat. The spearmen suddenly lost control of their steeds, and the two that could not hang on soon landed in the dirt. Darien and Rua were upon them in an instant. His target, like most of Aldrimar’s men, was a good man, his glyphmark strong, uncorrupted by malfeasance or sin. No better than meat for his purposes. Darien shoved his sword into his chest. The other though...  

“Master,” Rua said, gesturing towards where the carriage had opened and a man was climbing out. Aldrimar.  

Darien nodded, ordering Rua to deal with it. Darien turned back to the spearman and drove his sword into the man’s gut, causing him to cry out as his blood began to pour out into the dirt. A lethal would that would kill slowly, painfully. This man’s glyphmark was weak, and the man’s Life leaked away from him in wisps like smoke, filling his nose with the sweet scent of fresh power. A fine enough sacrifice for the True Art.  

“What is your name?” Darien ordered, prompting a confused look from the dying man. “Tell me, and your suffering ends.”  

“I...” the man choked. “Tim. My name is Tim. Plea-”  

Darien began chanting and felt the familiar tugging pulling at him, urging him forward into Death. Darien would not cross, not here. He cut the man’s neck with one hand, and with the other reached out into Death and grabbed the man’s, Tim’s, soul before the current took it. As he pulled it back into life, he wrapped it in a brilling violet loop of binding light.  

He spoke the ancient Words of binding, stripping Tim’s soul of its memory and its will and forcing it to follow his every order. A few more Words, and he forced part of the soul back into its former body, and the other part into his fallen friend. Together, the two spearmen rose shambled to their feet. Darien looked just in time to see the look of horror on Gareth Aldrimar’s face before Rua’s attack forced him out of his shock. Such was the proper reaction to watching a necromancer raise your own soldiers from the dead to attack you. He gave the spearmen their orders.  

Aldrimar had drawn his blade, a steel longsword with an ornate hilt and brilliant ruby set into its pommel, and was using it to defend himself quite competently. The sword in Rua’s hands, the longsword stolen from Aldrimar’s knight, rippled with heat as the deadly glow of a forge ran along its edge, Rua chanting his mantra. He had seen the man use this technique many times, helped him develop it and train with it to his surprise he watched as it failed to slice through Aldrimar’s blade, leaving only a tiny knick and a few sparks at each clash instead of melting right through the other sword like butter.  

“Bastards,” Gareth grunted as he blocked an overhead blow from Rua. He kicked the tall man back, and Darien urged the spearmen to rush in with their spears.  

Aldrimar spoke a Word, and Darien felt the spearmen in his awareness cut off with a sharp snap. Both corpses collapsed to the dirt, and Darien could see his spent power dissipating like smoke from embers. He tried to reach for the soul he had used, but it had already slipped away. What a waste of life, to be fed to another necromancer.  

A necromancer\! Aldrimar was a necromancer? How? His mark was uncorrupted...  

Darien wasted no time, drawing a binding around the man’s neck before he could make his next move, squeezing with everything he had. He imagined the band pulling tight around Aldrimar’s neck, and saw the man’s face contort. Then he felt a push against his own, and Aldrimar shouted a Word and slipped from Darien’s grip.  

“You’ve come to kill me so soon,” Aldrimar asked. “Truly? There must be more than I thought buried beneath that little farm then, Moongrave.”  

Darien allowed himself to smile as he locked eyes with his prey. He raised his sword, Aldrimar raised his own, and the two of them began to circle one another. The sun was a blazing orange inferno just above the horizon as they danced, testing each other with their blades. Darien struck first, spinning as he brought his sword around on Aldrimar in a fury of blows.  

Aldrimar countered and sword clanged against sword. Darien’s right shoulder froze as he swung, and it was only the quick approach of Rua with his burning blade that Aldrimar pulled his blow and spun away. As Rua pressed the attack, Darien couldn’t help but wonder why Aldrimar even now had gathered no power as he grabbed one of the prone horses and slit its neck, spilling out its Life. It wasn’t human life and would require as much from him as the horse brought to animate a worthwhile servant, but it would serve as fuel, and already he felt his shoulder getting stronger. It wasn’t that Aldrimar had no power at all, but he could have so much more if he would only take it.  

For his part, Aldrimar fought valiantly though it was over as quickly as it had begun. Darien had Aldrimar on the backfoot when Rua slipped in and drove his burning blade into the nobleman’s chest in a clean wound that smoked but hardly bled. With his lung punctured, Gareth Aldrimar had no final words though the contempt in gaze he held with Darien until his gray-green eyes glassed over filled Darien with a perverse pleasure he had not felt in over twenty years. He thought he would sleep well that night, his work, and his secrets secure.  

That night, after having left Rua to clean up their mess, he dreamed he was fighting a great white lion with Gareth Aldrimar’s hateful eyes. Though he managed to inflict a fierce wound upon the lion, he woke, gasping, as the lion closed its jaws around his neck.

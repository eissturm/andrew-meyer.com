This has been a hard review for me to write. Not because I didn't enjoy the book or have unkind things to say; in fact its the opposite, it's difficult for me not to gush about this book. Another concern was some statements I am going to make that I needed to wait until the end of the year to confirm. Let's begin.

[*Some Desperate Glory*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58388343-some-desperate-glory) by Emily Tesh is a space opera story set in a universe where humanity lost. Big time. As the forces of earth ventured out into the galaxy, they encountered a universe-spanning hegemony of alien races bent on ensuring the humans learned their peaceful ways. By force. Our hero, Valkyr, is one of of the last remnants of humanity, raised on a spare and desolate space station, called Gaia in memory of a home now lost, and someday soon, she's going to make the aliens pay for what they did.

From the first pages of this book, I was hooked. Valkyr, Kyr, is a protagonist you love to hate and Gaia Station is a too familiar hellhole that feeds on anger and misery. Every chapter ramped up the stakes until half way throught he book I thought they couldn't get any higher. Emily Tesh you're a madwoman.

## Plot and Pacing

From the very beginning, *Some Desperate Glory* had me hooked. Tesh expertly ramps up the tension in every chapter as the fate of the universe hangs in the balance. I won't say more than that without spoiling this book.

**Plot and Pacing Score: 5**

## Characters

The core cast of characters are all incredibly compelling and pracically jump off the page. Tesh does a fantastic job giving them each their own distinct voices and personalities. This is a masterful, mutli-faceted examination of character.

**Character Score: 5**

## Setting

Each location was a fully realized space in an even bigger universe. My only complaint how little of the universe we saw, and thus how "little" it wound up feeling. Most of the book is spent in space stations or alien installations, and doesn't offer much by way of "sweeping vistas" that I often enjoy in my space opera and my epic fantasy.

**Setting Score: 4**

## Prose

Emily Tesh's prose is clean and tight here. Each character felt distinct and realized. It was hard to pick out the author's own voice or style beyond the characters', but that could also be that this was my first exposure to Tesh's work.

**Prose Score: 4**

## Theme

Rarely do you get to see two sides of an argument explored so thoroghly. I'm applauding again.

**Theme Score: 5**

## Fun

Aside from a little bit at the beginning (I was worried we were going somewhere we weren't, it's all good), this book was a wild ride start to finish.

**Fun Score: 5**

## Overall Score: 4.7

*Some Desperate Glory* by Emily Tesh was my favorite book I read in 2024. I am Desperate for More of this universe Tesh has built.
